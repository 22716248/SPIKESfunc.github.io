					Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0.  If these criteria are met then the antagonist pA2 value (derived from the x-intercept) can typically be used as a measure of the affinity (-logKB) of the antagonist for the receptor mediating the agonist-induce response.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, if should be recognised that a linear Schild plot with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0 provides only presumptive evidence of competitive antagonism, not proof of competitive antagonism.  For example, under some restrictive conditions (e.g. use of a narrow antagonist concentration range), there are instances of allosteric, irreversible and functional antagonists generating Schild plots that satisfy the conditions of linearity and unit slope.  Thus, confirmatory evidence of competitive antagonism should be obtained from binding studies that directly evaluate the molecular interactions between ligands and receptors.
				</p>

				<span style="color: black;"> <b>(i)</b>  </span> <span style="color: blue;"> A clear strength of the Schild analysis is that the shape and position of the Schild plot should be: </span>


				<ol>
					<li>independent of the level of response (effect) used to calculate the dose ratio (DR), as competitive antagonists produce parallel, rightward shifts of agonist dose-response curves </li>
					<li>independent of the characteristics of the cell or tissue, such as receptor density and signal amplification </li>
					<li>independent of the characteristics of the agonist used, including affinity and efficacy</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					When used in conjunction with receptor-selective antagonists, the Schild analysis offers a powerful method for characterising receptor function in cells and tissues.

				<h3> <b>2#</b> Schild plot is linear with unit slope, but generates unreliable pA2 values </h3> <br>
				<img src="images/nonlinear/linear2.png">
				
				<button type="button" href="/quant.html this doesnt work" class="btn waves-effect waves-light red">Take me to a more detailed example.</button>

				<br><br><p>
					Ideally Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0.  Typically, if these criteria are met then the antagonist pA2 value (derived from the x-intercept) can theoretically be used as a measure of the affinity (-logKB) of the antagonist for the receptor mediating the agonist-induce response.   
				</p>
				<p>
					However, there are instances whereby linear Schild plots with unit slope have generated pA2 values that are not accurate estimates of the actual affinity of the antagonist for the receptor (-logKB value).  There are several mechanisms through which this phenomenon might occur, including the following.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<span style="color: black;"> <b>(i)</b>  </span> <span style="color: blue;"> The competitive antagonist has not been equilibrated with the tissue for sufficient time</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					If an antagonist cannot readily penetrate into a tissue (diffusion is a rate-limiting step), then the use of shorter-than-optimum equilibration times will generate Schild plots that are positioned to the right of plots obtained when longer, more appropriate equilibration times have been used (see Kenakin, 1982, p258).  Thus, the effect of a shorter-than-optimum equilibration time will be to under-estimate both the pA2 and affinity of the antagonist.  Of course, <i> this issue can be remedied by increasing the period of exposure of the antagonist such that complete equilibration of the antagonist with the receptor is achieved. </i>
				</p>

				<span style="color: black;"> <b>(ii)</b>  </span> <span style="color: blue;"> Additional drugs are being used in the study that also interact with the receptor </span>

				<p>
					It is often necessary to use additional drugs in Schild plot studies e.g. to inhibit uptake processes, degradative enzymes, and/or other receptor subtypes. If an additional drug, for example an uptake inhibitor, also possesses considerable receptor blocking activity, then the Schild plot for the competitive antagonist will be displaced to the right (proportional to the concentration of the uptake inhibitor).  Such an effect will result in under-estimation of both the pA2 and affinity of the antagonist (see Kenakin, 1982, p258). <i> This issue can be remedied by changing the additional drugs used to particular drugs that do not have an action at the receptor of interest.</i>

						<p><b>Summary about the project</b><br/>Agonists produce effects in cells by activating receptors and downstream signalling pathways. This app contains an interactive “Dose Response Visualiser” which allows users to alter agonist-dependent factors (affinity, intrinsic efficacy) and/or cell-dependent factors (receptor density, signal amplification) and observe in real time how this changes the agonist dose-response relationship.<br/>
							<br/>Agonist-induced effects can be blocked by drugs called antagonists, which are amongst the most widely used class of drug in medicine. There exist many different types of antagonists, named on the basis of how they inhibit the agonist-induced effect: competitive, irreversible, allosteric and functional antagonists, and inverse agonists. Within the “Dose Response Visualiser”, users can observe the different patterns of effect produced by each of these antagonists (and the influence of antagonist concentrations and affinity) on the agonist dose-response relationship.<br/>
							<br/>Quantitative analysis of the effect of competitive antagonists on agonist-induced effects is a powerful method for identifying the receptors that mediate agonist-induced effects (Schild analysis), and is used in drug discovery and receptor characterisation. The app contains a “Schild Plot Generator”, where users can select the properties of agonists and antagonists and generate Schild Plots, and work through a series of theoretical questions and experimental scenarios that build proficiency and enhance understanding of key Schild concepts.  The “Schild Plot Generator” also introduces users to a wide array of ‘non-ideal’ Schild Plots (e.g. nonlinear and/or slope different from unity), and moreover, provides users with information that can be used to identify and remedy the underlying causes of each form of ‘non-ideal’ Schild plot.<br/>
							<br/>These newly developed proficiencies and understandings can then be tested using the “Schild Analysis Quiz” tool within the app, were users are provided with a series of Schild Plots obtained to 5 antagonists acting on a single receptor subtype within a common cell, and users are challenged to analyse each of the Schild Plots using the SPIKES approach to deduce which single receptor subtype is mediating the agonist-induced response.  Feedback is provided for each of the literally 1000s of different quiz questions.<br/>
							<br/>Thus, SPIKESfunc is an interactive, educational application that boosts proficiency in the interpretation of functional pharmacological data through the visual and quantitative analysis of agonist and antagonist dose-response relationships. SPIKESfunc can be used in conjunction with SPIKESbind, a complementary interactive educational app designed to enhance proficiency in interpreting binding pharmacological data.<br/>
							<br/>The SPIKESfunc application was created by Cameron Turner, Daniel Brown, Harry Brooker and Thai Nguyen, and subsequent versions have been developed by Hannah Walkerden, Kuba Wysocki, Lyulyu Su, Ehsan Noori, Stanley McFarlane and Ye Liu, undergraduate students of the Professional Computing unit (CITS3200) at The University of Western Australia, as directed by Associate Professor Peter Henry of the Division of Pharmacology, School of Biomedical Sciences, UWA.<br/>
