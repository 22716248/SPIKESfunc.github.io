					Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0.  If these criteria are met then the antagonist pA2 value (derived from the x-intercept) can typically be used as a measure of the affinity (-logKB) of the antagonist for the receptor mediating the agonist-induce response.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, if should be recognised that a linear Schild plot with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0 provides only presumptive evidence of competitive antagonism, not proof of competitive antagonism.  For example, under some restrictive conditions (e.g. use of a narrow antagonist concentration range), there are instances of allosteric, irreversible and functional antagonists generating Schild plots that satisfy the conditions of linearity and unit slope.  Thus, confirmatory evidence of competitive antagonism should be obtained from binding studies that directly evaluate the molecular interactions between ligands and receptors.
				</p>

				<span style="color: black;"> <b>(i)</b>  </span> <span style="color: blue;"> A clear strength of the Schild analysis is that the shape and position of the Schild plot should be: </span>


				<ol>
					<li>independent of the level of response (effect) used to calculate the dose ratio (DR), as competitive antagonists produce parallel, rightward shifts of agonist dose-response curves </li>
					<li>independent of the characteristics of the cell or tissue, such as receptor density and signal amplification </li>
					<li>independent of the characteristics of the agonist used, including affinity and efficacy</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					When used in conjunction with receptor-selective antagonists, the Schild analysis offers a powerful method for characterising receptor function in cells and tissues.

					Ideally Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0.  Typically, if these criteria are met then the antagonist pA2 value (derived from the x-intercept) can theoretically be used as a measure of the affinity (-logKB) of the antagonist for the receptor mediating the agonist-induce response.   
				</p>
				<p>
					However, there are instances whereby linear Schild plots with unit slope have generated pA2 values that are not accurate estimates of the actual affinity of the antagonist for the receptor (-logKB value).  There are several mechanisms through which this phenomenon might occur, including the following.
				</p>
				
		
				<span style="color: black;"> <b>(i)</b>  </span> <span style="color: blue;"> The competitive antagonist has not been equilibrated with the tissue for sufficient time</span>

				<p>
					If an antagonist cannot readily penetrate into a tissue (diffusion is a rate-limiting step), then the use of shorter-than-optimum equilibration times will generate Schild plots that are positioned to the right of plots obtained when longer, more appropriate equilibration times have been used (see Kenakin, 1982, p258).  Thus, the effect of a shorter-than-optimum equilibration time will be to under-estimate both the pA2 and affinity of the antagonist.  Of course, <i> this issue can be remedied by increasing the period of exposure of the antagonist such that complete equilibration of the antagonist with the receptor is achieved. </i>
				</p>

				<span style="color: black;"> <b>(ii)</b>  </span> <span style="color: blue;"> Additional drugs are being used in the study that also interact with the receptor </span>

				<p>
					It is often necessary to use additional drugs in Schild plot studies e.g. to inhibit uptake processes, degradative enzymes, and/or other receptor subtypes. If an additional drug, for example an uptake inhibitor, also possesses considerable receptor blocking activity, then the Schild plot for the competitive antagonist will be displaced to the right (proportional to the concentration of the uptake inhibitor).  Such an effect will result in under-estimation of both the pA2 and affinity of the antagonist (see Kenakin, 1982, p258). <i> This issue can be remedied by changing the additional drugs used to particular drugs that do not have an action at the receptor of interest.</i>

					Ideally Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0.  However, there are several instances whereby the Schild plot deviates from linearity at low concentrations of antagonist, and the slope in this region of the plot is greater than 1.0 (see figure above).  This effect is typically indicative of several mechanisms, as follows:
				</p>
			
				<span style="color: black;"> <b>(i)</b>  </span> <span style="color: blue;"> The competitive antagonist is a substrate of a saturable uptake system	</span>

				<p>
					If the antagonist is a substrate of a saturable uptake system, then the concentration of the antagonist in the vicinity of the receptor is less than that predicted based on the concentration administered (to the solution surrounding the cells or tissue), resulting in a lower-than-expected level of antagonism of an agonist-induced response (smaller than predicted DR value). However, at higher concentrations of the antagonist, the uptake system becomes saturated and the concentration of antagonist in the vicinity of the receptor is closer to that predicted based on the dose administered, and the expected level of antagonism is produced.  
				</p>
				<p>
					<i> This issue can be remedied by blocking the saturable uptake system for which the antagonist is a substrate.  </i>
				</p>

				<span style="color: black;"> <b>(ii)</b>  </span> <span style="color: blue;"> Additional drugs are being used in the study that also interact with the receptor </span>

				<p>
					If an antagonist cannot readily equilibrate with the receptor, then lower concentrations of the antagonist require a longer period of time to equilibrate than higher concentrations.  Thus, if the equilibration time is shorter than that required for the lowest concentration of antagonist used, then these lower concentrations will be less effective and produce lower DR values than predicted (see Fig. 2, Kenakin, 1982, p257) – resulting in slopes greater than one at the lower regions of the Schild plot.
				</p>

				<p>
					<i> Of course, this issue can be remedied by increasing the period of exposure of the antagonist such that equilibration of the antagonist with the receptor is achieved. </i>

				<br><br><p>
					Ideally Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0.  However, there are some well-documented examples where the Schild plot deviates from linearity at low concentrations of antagonist, such that the slope in this region of the plot is less than 1.0 (see figure above).  This effect is typically related to the properties of the agonist, rather than the antagonist. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If the <span style="color: blue;">agonist is a substrate of a saturable uptake system</span>, then the concentration of the agonist in the vicinity of the receptor is less than that predicted based on the concentration administered (to the solution surrounding the cells or tissue), resulting in a lower-than-expected level of agonist-induced response – this will be particular evident in the control (no antagonist) agonist dose-response curve and those completed in the presence of low concentrations of antagonist. However, when higher concentrations of the agonist are used (e.g. in the presence of higher concentrations of the competitive antagonist) the uptake system for the agonist becomes saturated and the concentration of agonist in the vicinity of the receptor will be closer to that predicted based on the concentration administered, and the expected level of antagonism is produced (see Figure).  
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This effect has been extensively reported in relation to studies characterising adrenoceptors, as some adrenoceptor agonists (e.g. noradrenaline) are substrates of neuronal uptake systems, whereas other agonists (e.g. isoprenaline) are not substrates (see Kenakin (1982), p254). The magnitude of effect will depend on the tissue being investigated as the characteristics of saturable uptake systems varies considerably.  Of particular note, pA2 values obtained for antagonists when neuronal uptake of the agonist has not been blocked are unlikely to provide reliable measures of antagonist affinity.    				</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i> This issue can be remedied by blocking the saturable uptake system for which the agonist is a substrate, for example by using cocaine to block the neuronal uptake of noradrenaline.   </i>

					Ideally Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0. However, if the Schild plot deviates from linearity at high concentrations of antagonist, such that the slope in this region of the plot is greater than 1.0 (see figure above), then this may indicate that <span style="color: blue;" >high concentrations of either the agonist or antagonist are producing toxicity in these cells or tissue. </span>
				</p>

				<p>
					A characteristic feature of toxicity is reduced responsiveness of the cells/tissue to agonists, which is manifest as a decrease in agonist potency and maximum effect.  Thus, if only high concentrations (of agonist or antagonist) are producing toxicity, then elevated DR values produced by the combined effects of antagonist and toxicity will only be evident in the latter phases of the Schild plot.  In this instance, the lower concentrations of antagonist that are non-toxic can be reliably used to generate pA2 values and logKB values (if that portion of the Schild plot is linear with unit slope).   
				</p>

				<p>
					Of course,<i> this issue can be remedied by using competitive antagonists and agonists that are non-toxic.  As toxicity is typically concentration-dependent, the use of highly potent agonists and antagonists will likely be advantageous in this setting.     </i>

					Ideally Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0. As mentioned elsewhere, this plateauing of the Schild plot at high concentrations of antagonist is typically seen with allosteric antagonists. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					However, this phenomenon may also be observed with competitive antagonists under certain conditions (see Kenakin (1982), p256), as indicated below.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li style="color: blue;">
						high concentrations of antagonist increases the sensitivity of the tissue to the agonist 
					</li>
					<li style="color: blue;">
						high concentrations of the antagonist produce agonist-like responses in the tissue
					</li>
					<li style="color: blue;">
						high concentrations of the agonist activates a second type of receptor/pathway that mediates 			the same response, but which is not blocked by the antagonist
					</li>
					<li style="color: blue;">
						high concentrations of the agonist release an endogenous agonist that overcomes the	effects 			produced by the antagonist 	
					</li>

						<p><b>Summary about the project</b><br/>Agonists produce effects in cells by activating receptors and downstream signalling pathways. This app contains an interactive “Dose Response Visualiser” which allows users to alter agonist-dependent factors (affinity, intrinsic efficacy) and/or cell-dependent factors (receptor density, signal amplification) and observe in real time how this changes the agonist dose-response relationship.<br/>
							<br/>Agonist-induced effects can be blocked by drugs called antagonists, which are amongst the most widely used class of drug in medicine. There exist many different types of antagonists, named on the basis of how they inhibit the agonist-induced effect: competitive, irreversible, allosteric and functional antagonists, and inverse agonists. Within the “Dose Response Visualiser”, users can observe the different patterns of effect produced by each of these antagonists (and the influence of antagonist concentrations and affinity) on the agonist dose-response relationship.<br/>
							<br/>Quantitative analysis of the effect of competitive antagonists on agonist-induced effects is a powerful method for identifying the receptors that mediate agonist-induced effects (Schild analysis), and is used in drug discovery and receptor characterisation. The app contains a “Schild Plot Generator”, where users can select the properties of agonists and antagonists and generate Schild Plots, and work through a series of theoretical questions and experimental scenarios that build proficiency and enhance understanding of key Schild concepts.  The “Schild Plot Generator” also introduces users to a wide array of ‘non-ideal’ Schild Plots (e.g. nonlinear and/or slope different from unity), and moreover, provides users with information that can be used to identify and remedy the underlying causes of each form of ‘non-ideal’ Schild plot.<br/>
							<br/>These newly developed proficiencies and understandings can then be tested using the “Schild Analysis Quiz” tool within the app, were users are provided with a series of Schild Plots obtained to 5 antagonists acting on a single receptor subtype within a common cell, and users are challenged to analyse each of the Schild Plots using the SPIKES approach to deduce which single receptor subtype is mediating the agonist-induced response.  Feedback is provided for each of the literally 1000s of different quiz questions.<br/>
							<br/>Thus, SPIKESfunc is an interactive, educational application that boosts proficiency in the interpretation of functional pharmacological data through the visual and quantitative analysis of agonist and antagonist dose-response relationships. SPIKESfunc can be used in conjunction with SPIKESbind, a complementary interactive educational app designed to enhance proficiency in interpreting binding pharmacological data.<br/>
							<br/>The SPIKESfunc application was created by Cameron Turner, Daniel Brown, Harry Brooker and Thai Nguyen, and subsequent versions have been developed by Hannah Walkerden, Kuba Wysocki, Lyulyu Su, Ehsan Noori, Stanley McFarlane and Ye Liu, undergraduate students of the Professional Computing unit (CITS3200) at The University of Western Australia, as directed by Associate Professor Peter Henry of the Division of Pharmacology, School of Biomedical Sciences, UWA.<br/>
